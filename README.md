### 📝 Notes
- This is a frontend-only project. No backend logic (e.g., login, cart functionality, database) is implemented.
- All images are placed in the same folder as the HTML and CSS files — so no need to change any image paths.
- JavaScript and jQuery are written directly inside the HTML file:
   - Used for carousel control, dropdowns, countdown timer, and interactivity.
